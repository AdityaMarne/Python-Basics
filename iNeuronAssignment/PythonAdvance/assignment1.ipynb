    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python provides a way to structure programs by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. Here's why OOP is valuable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity and Reusability: OOP promotes code organization into logical classes. Each class encapsulates data (properties) and functions (methods). This modular approach makes it easier to understand, modify, and reuse code. You define a class once and can create multiple instances (objects) from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction and Encapsulation:\n",
    "   - Abstraction: Hide complex implementation details and expose only essential features. Users interact with high-level methods without needing to know the underlying complexity.\n",
    "   - Encapsulation: Bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. Access to data is controlled through methods, ensuring data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance:\n",
    "   - Create a new class (child class) based on an existing class (parent class). The child class inherits properties and behaviors from the parent class.\n",
    "   - Allows code reuse and specialization. You can override or extend methods in the child class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism:\n",
    "   - Refers to the ability of different classes to be treated uniformly.\n",
    "   - You can use the same method name across different classes, and Python will dynamically choose the appropriate implementation based on the object type."

    "When Python looks for an attribute (such as a variable or method) in an object, it follows a specific order called the Method Resolution Order (MRO). Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instance Attributes:\n",
    "   - First, Python checks if the attribute exists directly in the instance (object) itself.\n",
    "   - If found, it uses that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Class Attributes:\n",
    "   - If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python looks in the class of the instance.\n",
    "   - If the attribute exists in the class, it uses that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parent Classes (Inheritance):\n",
    "   - If the attribute is still not found, Python looks in the parent classes (superclasses) of the current class.\n",
    "   - It follows the inheritance hierarchy (base classes) to find the attribute.\n",
    "   - The order of searching parent classes is determined by the C3 Linearization algorithm (C3 superclass linearization).\n",
    "   - Python starts with the current class, then its parent classes, and so on until it reaches the top-level base class (usually `object`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Built-in Classes:\n",
    "   - If the attribute is not found in any of the parent classes, Python checks the built-in classes (e.g., `object`, `list`, `str`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. AttributeError:\n",
    "   - If the attribute is not found anywhere, Python raises an `AttributeError`."

Its purpose is to set up the object's initial state by assigning values to its properties (attributes). Let's explore this with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Person:\n",

    "   ```python\n",

    "   p3.say_hi()  # Output: \"Hello, my name is Anshul\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   You can create multiple `Person` objects with different names.\n",
