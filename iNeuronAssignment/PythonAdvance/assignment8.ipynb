    "Class-based exceptions in Python are matched to handlers using the try and except blocks. When an exception is raised, Python searches for an except block that matches the type of the exception. If a match is found, the corresponding block is executed. If no match is found, the exception propagates up the call stack until a matching handler is found or the program terminates."

With the introduction of exception classes, exceptions can now be organized hierarchically, making it easier to handle related exceptions together and providing more flexibility and clarity in exception handling."
