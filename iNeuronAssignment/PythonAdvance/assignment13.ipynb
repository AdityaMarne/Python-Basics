    "### Q1. Can you create a programme or function that employs both positive and negative indexing? Is there any repercussion if you do so?\n",
    "Yes, you can create a function that uses both positive and negative indexing. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def access_elements(my_list):\n",
    "    # Positive indexing\n",
    "    first_element = my_list[0]\n",
    "    third_element = my_list[2]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Negative indexing\n",
    "    last_element = my_list[-1]\n",
    "    second_last_element = my_list[-2]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return first_element, third_element, last_element, second_last_element\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "print(access_elements(my_list))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using both positive and negative indexing in a function does not have any negative repercussions. It simply provides more flexibility in accessing elements from both ends of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is the most effective way of starting with 1,000 elements in a Python list? Assume that all elements should be set to the same value.\n",
    "The most effective way to create a list with 1,000 elements, all set to the same value, is to use list multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [0] * 1000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is concise and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How do you slice a list to get any other part while missing the rest? (For example, suppose you want to make a new list with the elements first, third, fifth, seventh, and so on.)\n",
    "You can achieve this by using slicing with a step:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "sliced_list = my_list[::2]\n",
    "print(sliced_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which includes every second element starting from the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. Explain the distinctions between indexing and slicing.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: Accesses a single element from a list using its position. For example, `my_list[0]` accesses the first element.\n",
    "- **Slicing**: Accesses a subset of elements from a list. It uses a range of indices and can include a step. For example, `my_list[1:5:2]` accesses elements from index 1 to 4, with a step of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What happens if one of the slicing expression's indexes is out of range?\n",
    "If a slicing expression's index is out of range, Python handles it gracefully by stopping at the end of the list without raising an error. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(my_list[1:10])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will output `[2, 3]` without any error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. If you pass a list to a function, and if you want the function to be able to change the values of the list—so that the list is different after the function returns—what action should you avoid?\n",
    "You should avoid reassigning the list to a new list within the function. Instead, modify the list in place. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst[0] = 100  # This modifies the original list\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Outputs: [100, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the concept of an unbalanced matrix?\n",
    "An unbalanced matrix is a matrix where the rows have different numbers of elements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "unbalanced_matrix = [\n",
    "    [1, 2, 3],\n",
    "    [4, 5],\n",
    "    [6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Why is it necessary to use either list comprehension or a loop to create arbitrarily large matrices?\n",
    "Using list comprehension or a loop is necessary to create arbitrarily large matrices because it allows you to dynamically generate the matrix based on the desired size. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "rows, cols = 3, 4\n",
    "matrix = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a 3x4 matrix filled with zeros. List comprehensions and loops provide the flexibility to create matrices of any size efficiently."
