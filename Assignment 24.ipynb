    "In Python, both `def` statements and `lambda` expressions are used to create functions. Here are some key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Syntax: `def` is a statement that defines a function with a name, while `lambda` is an expression that creates an anonymous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Return Statement: `def` defined functions do not return anything if not explicitly returned, whereas the `lambda` function does return an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Namespace: `def` functions must be declared in the namespace, while `lambda` functions can be used without any declaration in the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Functionality: `def` functions can perform any Python task including multiple conditions, nested conditions or loops of any level, printing, importing libraries, raising Exceptions, etc. On the other hand, `lambda` functions are like single-line functions and are more limited in their operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Execution Time: The execution time of a program is faster for the same operation performed using `lambda` functions compared to `def` defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Readability: `def` defined functions are easier to interpret, while interpretation might be tricky for `lambda` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "every function created with `lambda` can also be created with `def`. However, this is not the case the other way around. It's recommended to use"

    "`map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` are three fundamental functions of functional programming in Python that allow you to operate over a sequence of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.map(): The `map()` function iterates through all items in the given iterable and executes the function we passed as an argument on each of them. The syntax is: `map(function, iterable(s))`. We can pass as many iterable objects as we want after passing the function we want to use. The output of `map()` is an iterator that returns the transformed items.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.filter(): The `filter()` function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. In simple words, filter() forms a new list that contains only elements that satisfy a certain condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.reduce(): The `reduce()` function works differently than `map()` and `filter()`. It does not return a new list based on the function and iterable we've passed. Instead, it returns a single value. Also, in Python 3 `reduce()` isn't a built-in function anymore, and it can be found in the `functools` module. The syntax is: `reduce(function, sequence[, initial])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these methods expect a function object as the first argument. This function object can be a pre-defined method with a name (like `def add (x,y)`). Though, more often than not, functions passed to `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` are the ones you'd use only once, so there's often no point in defining a referenceable function¹. To avoid defining a new function for your different `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()` needs - a more elegant solution would be to use a short, disposable, anonymous function that you will only use once and never again - a lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three functions allow you to apply a function across a number of iterables, in one fell swoop. They allow the programmer to write simpler, shorter code, without necessarily needing to bother about intricacies like loops and branching."
